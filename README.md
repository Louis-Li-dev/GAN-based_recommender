<h1>GAN-Based Recommender</h1>
  The proposed cycleGAN implemented in the system has been published in 2024 ISRS conference. 
  The embedded GAN-based recommender system was also presented at TGIS conference.
  This system incorporates a recommender and a style transfer model to provide maximum recommendation experience. It primarily focuses on attractions in Japan. However, with further tuning, it can be applied to other places around the world.
